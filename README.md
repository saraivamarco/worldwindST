# Summary
The increasing amount of debris orbiting Earth could potentially limit our access to space, 
impacting not only exploration efforts, but routine aspects of our life on Earth. 
Our challenge was to develop an open-source geospatial application that displays and locates 
every known debris object orbiting Earth in real time.
